96,1948562,Summer Youth Program Instructor,"<div><strong>About Urban Growers Collective </strong></div><div><br>Urban Growers Collective (UGC) was founded by Laurell Sims and Erika Allen in the fall of 2017. Rooted in Growing Food, we cultivate nourishing environments which support health, economic development, healing and creativity through urban agriculture. Our approach is to demonstrate and support development of community-based food systems where produce is grown, prepared, and distributed within neighborhoods. In this way, communities help themselves by learning how to provide for their own needs in a sustainable manner. </div><div><br>We operate seven urban farms on 11-acres of land predominantly located on Chicago’s south-side. These farms are production oriented with staff integrating education, training, and production to meet program goals. Each farm site ‘demonstrates’ the capacity for both large volumes of production and the ecological and social impacts of farming in society. In addition to farming on 11-acres in Chicago, Urban Growers Collective focuses on two key areas: food access and education. To address food access, we operate the Fresh Moves Mobile Markets, a program that transformed three buses into farmers’ markets on wheels and sells fresh, culturally appropriate food on the West and Southside of Chicago. Our education programs include youth employment, farmer training, a head-start preschool farm, as well as urban agriculture and equity building workshops and events. </div><div><br>Our core values as an organization honor shared leadership and collective decision making; racial, economic, gender and LGBTQ equity; as well as employee well being: we have witnessed how these values lead to thoughtful, holistic programming and yield environments that nourish and create prosperity. </div><div><br>About Urban Growers Collective’s Youth Corps </div><div><br>Urban Growers Collective Youth Corps engages and employs over 300 youth annually throughout our urban farm sites. Our farms serve as a safe space for teens to explore their interests, work collectively, share their talents and learn from one another. During their time spent on the farms, youth expand their understanding of many aspects of urban farming and community food system development. </div><div><br>Through hands-on instruction, teens learn the technical skills essential for farming in an urban environment. Teens grow organic vegetables, herbs and flowers and participate in all phases of farm production. Teens learn to produce compost, prep growing beds, and how to identify, plant, harvest and market the vegetables growing at the farm. They also assist with general farm tasks, pest management, site beautification and infrastructure development. At many of our locations, youth also manage an onsite farm stand, increasing access to fresh, healthy, affordable produce for their community, and providing a window into the economic and entrepreneurial opportunities that exist within food system development.<br><br></div><div>In addition to hands-on instruction at the farm, youth explore the science behind farming, through several inquiry-based experiments and take part in nutrition, hunger, cooking, art, food justice and food politics activities. This program aims to serve as both a job training experience and to encourage leadership development. It is our goal that teens graduate with a comprehensive understanding of sustainable food system development and the ability to connect and communicate how the skills they’ve gained at the farm translate to any career path they may follow. </div><div><br><strong>Position Description </strong></div><div><br>The Youth Program Instructor will specifically focus on providing instruction during the Urban Growers Collective Youth Corps Summer Program, a six-week program focused on farming, community food system development and leadership.

They rely on the administrative assistant to keep notes, files, and evidence cataloged systematically for easy retrieval and use.<br><br><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Good administrative assistants are flexible and able to quickly adapt to changing tasks and needs of clients. As cases proceed, lawyers rely on administrative assistants to find information in the file or on the internet. In some instances, there may only be a matter of hours or days to find case documentation or other resources and produce them for the lawyer. It is a high-paced environment that can be stressful given the rigorous demands, so administrative assistants should be able to remain calm while dealing with the demands placed on them.<br><br><strong>Independence</strong>: Administrative assistants are commonly noted as good positions for people with more introverted personalities. Much of your work time is spent autonomously reading through case files and organized documents. Lawyers do not have time to repeatedly offer detailed guidance on every task, so it is important administrative assistants are quick learners and take detailed notes to ensure consistent and accurate work product.<br><br><strong>Precision: </strong>Along with working well under pressure, administrative assistants need a strong ability to deliver accurate information and details. Lawyers usually rely on the resources provided by administrative assistants. Failure to double-check the accuracy of the documents for proper formatting and grammar may be harmful to a case. Good writing skills accompany this need for accuracy as administrative assistants create documents and legal contracts used in formal agreements.<br><br><strong>Ability to Prioritize:</strong> It is important for administrative assistants to be able to handle multiple tasks and assignments, prioritize more important tasks while maintaining a good handle on others, and timely communicate any barriers to success to allow for opportunities for adjustment of deadlines.<br><br><strong>Self-driven</strong>: Administrative assistants fully own their scope of work, clear blockers, and manage priorities effectively without requiring excessive direction.
