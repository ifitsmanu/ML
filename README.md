# Job Post Neural Network
This project aims to analyze job postings and predict the number of applicants based on various features of the job posting, such as job title, job description, pay range, and location.



## Project Overview
The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn 
- spaCy
- textstat
- nltk

The project contains a machine learning pipeline that processes the data, extracts features, and trains a GradientBoostingRegressor model to predict the number of applicants for a given job posting.


## Installation and Setup
1. Install Python 3.9 or later.
2. Clone this repository:`https://github.com/CareerPlug/heckathon_job_posting_python`
2. Change to the project directory:
cd heckaton_job_posting
3. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):
`python3 -m venv cp_job_3
source cp_job_3/bin/activate`
4. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python -m spacy download en_cor_web_sm`

## Usage
 1. Run main.py to train model: 
 `python main.py`
 The script will train the model, evaluate its performance, and save the pipeline as `job_posting_pipeline.pkl.`

## File Structure
- `main.py`: The main script that loads the data, preprocesses it, and trains the machine learning pipeline.
- `custom_transformers.py`: Contains custom transformers used in the pipeline for feature extraction.
- `output.csv`: The job posting data in CSV format.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages for the project.
`job_posting_pipeline.pkl`: The saved machine learning pipeline, generated by running the main script.# ML
